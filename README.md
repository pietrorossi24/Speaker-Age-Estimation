# Refression Models for Speaker Age Estimation

The goal of this project is to develop a data science pipeline for predicting the speaker’s age for each audio recording.
This is achieved by extracting a diverse set of speech-derived features and computing various statistical descriptors as model inputs. 
Our approach first evaluates a Random Forest Regressor as the primary baseline. 
Performance is then further improved using Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, yielding satisfactory results.
